# Udacity-Projects

This is where I will house my completed blog website project from the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program.

This project allowed me to showcase my HTML and CSS skills that I learned during the course and really allowed me to let my creativity run wild as I made decisions on how I wanted the site to look and feel.
